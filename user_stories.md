#The marketing research team
As a marketing research team, I want to see an interactive websites with the products.
As a marketing research team, I want to see the name of a product.
As a marketing research team, I want to see how many times users viewed the items and how many times it was voted, so that I can be informed about how to customers like represented products.
As a marketing research team, I want see different images each time.

#The developer
As a focus group participant, I want to build a website that select three random photos from the image directory and display them side-by-side-by-side in the browser window.
As a focus group participant, I want a webpage be able to receive clicks on those displayed images, and track those clicks for each image. 
As a developer, I want want to track how many times each image is displayed, for statistical purposes.
As a developer, I want upon receiving a click, three new non-duplicating random images need to be automatically displayed.
As a developer, I want want to have a constructor function that creates an object associated with each image, and has (at a minimum) properties for the name of the image (to be used for display purposes), its filepath, the number of times it has been shown, and the number of times it has been clicked.
As a developer, I want after 25 selections have been made, turn off the event listeners on the images (to prevent additional voting) and also display a list of the products with votes received with each list item.
#The focus group participant
As a focus group participant, I want a webpage that displays what the website about and 3 products with a picture, so that I cab be informed about that business.
As a focus group participant, I want to see each time 3 new pictures.
As a focus group participant, I want to vote for some pictures among 3 shown to me, so that I can choose wich one I like.
As a focus group participant, I want to see how many votes each pictures got in the end.
